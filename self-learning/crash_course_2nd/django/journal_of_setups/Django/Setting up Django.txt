Create a file directory
In that file directory in the command line use the following command to create a virtual env
 #	python -m venv ll_env

To activate the virtual env we need to run the following command on Windows
#	ll_env\Scripts\activate

Packages can now be installed on the virtual env
# 	pip install django

The process for creating a project in django looks like this
#	django-admin startproject learning_log .
Take note of the full stop at the end. This is needs to be present.
By using dir you will see the current files exist
	settings.py - controls how Django interacts with system
	urls.py - which pages to build in browser requests
	wsgi.py - helps Django serve the files it creates. Web server gateway interface

Django needs a database to store its information; thus, we will create one. 
#	python manage.py migrate

We can view the project in its current state by running the server
# 	python manage.py runserver
